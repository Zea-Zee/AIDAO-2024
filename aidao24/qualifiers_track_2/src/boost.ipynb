    "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a neuroimaging technique that enables the study of brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow. Unlike conventional MRI, which provides static images of brain structures, fMRI captures dynamic changes related to neural activity. This technique capitalizes on the Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent (BOLD) signal, which varies with the level of blood oxygenation. Active brain regions consume more oxygen, leading to alterations in the magnetic properties of hemoglobin depending on its oxygenation state. fMRI detects these variations, allowing researchers to identify specific brain areas activated in response to various stimuli or tasks. The data generated are three-dimensional images of the brain, where each voxel corresponds to a time series depicting changes in blood oxygen levels over time, effectively producing a four-dimensional dataset."

    "fMRI is utilized across diverse disciplines, including medicine, where it assists in neurosurgical planning and the diagnosis of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as epilepsy and schizophrenia. In psychophysiology, fMRI is employed to investigate brain function under normal and pathological conditions, as well as to study cognitive processes like memory, attention, and language.\n",
    "\n",
    "A central objective in fMRI research is the classification of human brain states based on functional activity, as reflected in the BOLD signal. fMRI data are collected during resting states and during engagement in various tasks (e.g., solving cognitive problems), under both normal and pathological conditions, and across different levels of consciousness (e.g., wakefulness, sleep, anesthesia, coma). In clinical settings, accurately classifying pathological brain states is of paramount importance. Employing machine learning techniques to classify brain states presents a promising avenue for research. To effectively apply these methods to complex conditions—such as differentiating between healthy individuals and patients with schizophrenia, or among subtypes of schizophrenia—it is essential to validate their performance on simpler cases. A notable challenge with fMRI data is its high variability, originating from multiple sources, including differences in data acquisition protocols. Consequently, data acquired from different scanners and by different technicians may vary significantly, complicating model generalization across datasets.\n"

    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "One fundamental state of the human brain is the resting state with either eyes open or eyes closed. It is well-established that these states exhibit differences, particularly affecting the brain's visual cortex and associated structures. Experts can distinguish between these states through visual inspection of fMRI data. The objective of this research is to determine whether machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) approaches can accurately differentiate between these states. It is especially important to develop a model that can be trained on one dataset (e.g., publicly available data) and applied to proprietary data (e.g., clinical data from a specific institution).\n",
    "\n",
    "This project proposes the development of an effective methodology for classifying resting states with eyes open and eyes closed using machine learning techniques. Two datasets are provided: data from various research projects at the Institute of the Human Brain of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IHB RAS) and an open dataset from Beijing Normal University. Both datasets consist of fMRI scans under two conditions—eyes closed and eyes open—and are presented as time-series data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the high dimensionality of raw fMRI data (e.g., 120 x 142 x 50 voxels in the IHB dataset), dimensionality reduction is commonly performed using brain atlases. These atlases partition the brain into regions corresponding to specific anatomical structures, allowing for the averaging of time series across all voxels within a region.\n"
